<h1>What is a plugin?</h1>
<p>In <strong>Plug n' Code</strong>, a plugin consists of two parts,</p>
<ul>
  <li>A dockerfile</li>
  <li>Run commands</li>
</ul>
<h1>How does a plugin work?</h1>
<p><strong>Dockerfile</strong> holds the settings to be used while creating a docker image.</p>
<p>This is done when a new project is created, or an existing one is either imported or saved.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Run commands</strong> are the more customizable part of a plugin.</p>
<p>Where a dockerfile is only used when building a docker image, run commands are used to handle the execution of the project on each run.</p>
<p>These can be customized from the settings menu on the index page.</p>
