<h1>What is an entrypoint?</h1>
<p>Entrypoint is a file which determines from where the execution of a project will start.</p>
<p>Different languages have different concepts of entrypoints. To avoid such confusion, <strong>Plug n' Code</strong> asks for the entrypoint in all projects regardless of the language.</p>
<p>This entrypoint is accessible in the run commands via variables <pre>filename</pre> and <pre>basename</pre></p>
