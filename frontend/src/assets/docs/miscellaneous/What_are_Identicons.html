<h1>What are identicons? or What is wrong with my profile icon?</h1>
<p>An Identicon is a visual representation of a hash value, that serves to identify a user of a computer system as a form of avatar while protecting the users' privacy.</p>
<p><strong>Plug n' Code</strong> uses a library called <em>Jdenticon</em> to generate unique identicons based on user's names.</p>
