<h1>How to share code snippets from my project?</h1>
<p>To share a code snippet, open the file with the content you would like to share, in the editor.</p>
<p>Make sure the file has some content in it, or the share code function won't work.</p>
<p>Select the share icon from the toolbar on the top, you'll be prompted for a title for your snippet.</p>
<p>This title needs to be unique since it will be used in creating a permalink for your snippet.</p>
<p>On successful snippet creation, you'll see an alert with the sharable link to your newly shared snippet. You can also go the <a href="/blog">blog</a> to check out snippets shared by others.</p>
